# DRIPIFY STRATEGY: 2 CLEAR CATEGORIES
# Category 1: NEW PROSPECTS (Cold connection requests)
# Category 2: EXISTING CONNECTIONS (Warm contacts - may or may not have responded before)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# CATEGORY 1: NEW PROSPECTS (Cold Outreach)
## Goal: Get connection + any response → go manual

### CONNECTION REQUEST (Same military story - works perfectly)
```
{FirstName},

I was a damn good salesman.
Two years back, I'd have sold you my developers so well you'd buy three extra :)
Last year, radio silence - was off fighting a war...
Now, I'm back.
Wonder what changed?
```

### STEP 1: Thanks + Choice Game (Day 1 after connection)
```
Yeah, {FirstName}!

Thanks for connecting!

Just curious - what hooked you?
Wanna to know my story?
Was it "finally, a normal connection request"?)
Couldn't say no to someone in military uniform?)
Or you actually want to know more and explore cooperation?
```

### STEP 2: The Confession (Day 4 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

Okay, confession time.

I'm sitting here with 200+ developers who keep asking "hey, remember that CTO from [Company]? Think he's hiring?"

And I'm like... dude, I barely remember what I had for breakfast )

Should I just start a group chat? "Lost CTOs and Available Devs Support Group"?
```

### STEP 3: Final Exit (Day 7 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

Last one, promise.

If you ever need developers and remember "that weird military guy with developer problems," you know where to find me.

If not, thanks for the connection and letting me practice my LinkedIn comedy )

Stay awesome!
```

# CATEGORY 2: EXISTING CONNECTIONS (Warm Contacts)
## Goal: Re-engage old connections with adapted military story

### STEP 1: The Reconnection (Day 1)
```
{FirstName},

Hey! Long time no talk.

So here's a weird update: remember how I used to bug you about developers? 
Well, life took a turn - closed the company, went to serve...

Now I'm back and guess what? All my best developers are still around, still coding, still being ridiculously good at what they do.

Small world, right?
```

### STEP 2: The Realization (Day 4 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

You know what's funny?

Two years ago I was selling you developers like a maniac.
Last year I wasn't talking to anyone (busy dodging bullets).
This year I'm getting texts from 200+ developers asking "hey, can you help us find work?"

Life's got a twisted sense of humor )

How's your team doing these days?
```

### STEP 3: The Group Chat Idea (Day 7 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

Plot twist time.

I'm literally sitting here with developers asking "remember that startup CTO? Is he hiring?" 

And I'm like... dude, we connected ages ago, I have no idea what he's up to )

Should I just make a group chat? "Old LinkedIn Contacts Who Might Need Developers Anonymous"?

Any survival tips for navigating this mess?
```

### STEP 4: The Honest Check-in (Day 10 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

Real talk - I have zero clue if you're even hiring or happy with your team.

But if you ever think "damn, wish I knew someone with good developers," well... now you do )

Either way, hope you're crushing it!
```

### STEP 5: The Graceful Exit (Day 13 if no response)
```
{FirstName},

Last message, promise.

Thanks for being in my network through all the chaos. If paths cross again and you need developers, you know where to find me.

If not, no worries - stay awesome and keep building cool stuff!
```
